# Proof of concept XRPL Metamask Snap

Based on `@metamask/template-snap`

This snap supports 3 commands:
* `ping` (sends a ping to the rippled node, and displays the result)
* `storeSeed` (stores the seed of a wallet)
* `signMessage` (signs a message using the stored seed)

You will need to download [MetaMask Flask](https://metamask.io/flask/), the development version of MetaMask, to interact with this snap.
